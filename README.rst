The `pytest-bdd-report` plugin is a useful extension for the `pytest-bdd`_ library that allows you to generate
useful and informative reports for BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) tests developed using the pytest-bdd framework.
This plugin facilitates the generation of clear and effective HTML reports, providing a comprehensible view of BDD test executions within the project.
