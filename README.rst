The `pytest-bdd-report` plugin is a useful extension for the `pytest-bdd`_ library that allows you to generate
useful and informative reports for BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) tests developed using the pytest-bdd framework.
This plugin facilitates the generation of clear and effective HTML reports, providing a comprehensible view of BDD test executions within the project.

For more, check out the `Documentation`_

----

This `pytest`_ plugin was generated with `Cookiecutter`_ along with `@hackebrot`_'s `cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`_ template.


Features
--------

* **Detailed BDD Reports**: The pytest-bdd-report plugin enables the generation of detailed reports for BDD tests executed using pytest-bdd. These reports clearly show the executed steps, tested scenarios, and obtained results.
* **HTML Format**: The generated reports are presented in an intuitive and interactive HTML format. This allows developers, testers, and other team members to easily view the status of BDD tests.
* **Easy Installation**: Installing the plugin is simple and fast. You can install it using the command `pip install pytest-bdd-report`.


Requirements
------------

* Jinja2
* pytest
* pytest-bdd


Installation
------------

1. Ensure that you have `pytest`_ and `pytest-bdd`_ installed in your development environment.
2. Open a terminal window.
3. Execute the following command to install the `pytest-bdd-report` plugin via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_

::

    $ pip install pytest-bdd-report


Usage
-----

Once installed, you can generate BDD reports in an HTML file using the following command:

::

    $ pytest --bdd-report="report.html"

Attach a screenshot to the HTML report generated by pytest-bdd-report, by using the provided attach.screenshot() method.

This helper function lets you attach screenshots either from raw bytes (e.g. page.screenshot() in Playwright) or from a file path on disk.
The screenshot will automatically appear inside the corresponding Feature → Scenario section of the final report.

Example with Playwright
=======================

.. code-block:: python

    from pytest_bdd_report import attach

    @pytest.hookimpl(hookwrapper=True)
    def pytest_bdd_step_error(request, feature, scenario, step, step_func, step_func_args, exception):
        yield
        for fixture in step_func_args.values():
            page = getattr(fixture, "page", None)
            if page:
                # Attach screenshot from bytes
                screenshot_bytes = page.screenshot()

                attach.screenshot(screenshot_bytes, feature.name, scenario.name) # pytest-bdd-report code to attach the screenshot

                # Attach screenshot from image path
                screenshot_path = "screenshot_path/test.png"
                page.screenshot(path=screenshot_path)

                attach.screenshot(screenshot_path, feature.name, scenario.name) # pytest-bdd-report code to attach the screenshot
